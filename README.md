# SocialMediaInsights
Social Media Analytics Project

Most companies are aware that social media network is no longer just a tool to share photos, videos and interaction with friends and family. More than ever, social media has been used by people as a platform to spread their opinions on several matters, including reviews on companiesâ€™ products. This large volume of data, constantly updated, made social media one of the main sources of Big Data. Thus, it is necessary to use the right techniques and tools to extract value from these data sources with acceptable performance, so companies can act within a timely manner. This paper brings up important questions when dealing with such large amount of data coming from a data streaming source by using PySpark, the Python language library to work with Apache Spark Servers.

The main goal of this project is to develop a customizable tool to acquire, clean and store data from the Twitter platform using Apache Spark as a scalable framework to process large amounts of data.
